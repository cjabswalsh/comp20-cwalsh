# Lab 9: Finalizing the Learning Portfolio #

1. This Git repository is so that we can have a portfolio of projects that can be shown to employers and interested parties.

2. I really enjoyed the mbta assignment, because it was my first time really working with JavaScript and external APIs. It was rewarding to see it come together.

3. Between this course and COMP40, I think I've grown a huge amount as a programmer. Taking those two courses at the same time proved to be very interesting, because I got to see two very different sides of the development spectrum (low-level and high-level) at the same time.

4. I felt like this course gave me more of a sense of what it's like to actually develop a product - to google for solutions and use documentation. The best example of this is the group project, because we're really _developing a product_, but assignment 3 also gave some sense of that, because I had to parse through someone else's code and look up how to use various parts of express and node.js.

5. I'd really like to get a deeper sense of how the Internet works - packets, routing, protocols, etc. So I guess I'll look for COMP112 sometime next year.
